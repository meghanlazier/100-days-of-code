# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through Week 4 of SuperHi foundations in HTML, CSS + Javascript. Learning about in-line block elements and varying widths using classes.

**Thoughts:** I definitely need to read more about in-line elements. I felt like the tutorial went through this really quickly. I plan on reading more of SuperHi's Learn to Code now this evening.

### Day 2: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through Week 4 of SuperHi foundations in HTML, CSS + Javascript. Today I'm focusing on flexbox and positioning elements.

**Thoughts:** I want to take some offline notes on what I'm learning. 

### Day 3: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started working through Free Code Camp's font-end development program. It was strange to add CSS into the HTML and not put the CSS in a separate document, but looking forward to progressing through the program and contrasting it to SuperHi.

**Thoughts:** Two steps forward, one step back.
