# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through Week 4 of SuperHi foundations in HTML, CSS + Javascript. Learning about in-line block elements and varying widths using classes.

**Thoughts:** I definitely need to read more about in-line elements. I felt like the tutorial went through this really quickly. I plan on reading more of SuperHi's Learn to Code now this evening.

### Day 2: December 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through Week 4 of SuperHi foundations in HTML, CSS + Javascript. Today I'm focusing on flexbox and positioning elements.

**Thoughts:** I want to take some offline notes on what I'm learning. 

### Day 3: December 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I started working through Free Code Camp's font-end development program. It was strange to add CSS into the HTML and not put the CSS in a separate document, but looking forward to progressing through the program and contrasting it to SuperHi.

**Thoughts:** Two steps forward, one step back. 


### Day 4: December 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More CSS flexbox, hover styles and image transition using SuperHi's week 4 tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I want to spend more time today reading SuperHi's Learn to Code now.

### Day 5: December 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Joined lesson 1 of Hear Me Code to learn python basics!

**Thoughts:** Something new and different! :)

### Day 6: December 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Going through Internetting Is Hard's intro to HTML/CSS

**Thoughts:** SuperHi skips some of the basics in the interest of making beautful site, so it's been good to have a refresher on absolute/relative links and other things I've forgotten about.

### Day 7: December 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on form formatting and styling, both HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** I can't believe it's been a week!

### Day 8: December 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the HTML5 + CSS modules from Free Code Camp. Moved on to responsive design in Bootstrap.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely motivated by seeing all of the modules in Free Code Camp's front-end dev certificate. That's something I want to accomplish in 100 days!

### Day 9: December 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked my way through Free Code Camp's responsive design in bootstrap! Now I'm moving on to .jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely motivated by seeing all of the modules in Free Code Camp's front-end dev certificate. That's something I want to accomplish in 100 days!

### Day 10: December 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked my way through more .jQuery. Started my first project, buiding a tribute page, on Free Code Camp using CodePen.

**Thoughts:** Enjoying seeing what I've retained and what I need to look up to complete my first page.

### Day 11: December 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on week 5 of Superhi's HTML + CSS course. More flexbox + hero background positioning. 

**Thoughts:** Two steps forward one step back.

### Day 12: December 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I was back at it on FreeCodeCamp delving into Javascript. 

**Thoughts:** Definitley going slower through the JavaScript tutorials than the HTML and CSS. I keep telling myself that JavaScript is new so it's OK to slow down, but working on Python at Hear Me Code has given me a boost of confidence that I can do it!

### Day 13: December 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more of SuperHi's week five course, which is now starting to get into some basic .jQuery and Javascript. 

**Thoughts:** This week has been crazy, so I haven't been able to stick to my normal schedule. I'm happy to get back to it today! :)

### Day 14: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished week 5 of SuperHi's HTML, CSS and Javascript course! Finally using some .jQuery and Javascript. 

**Thoughts:** Back at it after a bit of a break for the holidays and my birthday. Feeling a little rusty, but happy to jump back in.

### Day 15: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished week 6 of SuperHi's HTML, CSS and Javascript course. Definitely spent more than an hour on this today. I'm also trying to debug some of the code I wrote. 

**Thoughts:** Felt good to get through week 6 in one day! Definitely going to try to push longer than an hour the next few days.

### Day 16: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through part one of SuperHi's HTML, CSS and Javascript course, week 7, on lightboxes and modals. I also read some of SuperHi's book.

**Thoughts:** 
This seems so useful and practical for future projects.

### Day 17: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished week 7 of SuperHi. Worked on setting variables, reusing code and else if statements. I have some buggy code, so will work on fixing it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** I need some supplemental reading on variables and if/then/else statements.

### Day 18: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through week of of SuperHi! Last week of the course.

**Thoughts:** Need some time for debugging code tomorrow.

### Day 19: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished my first course in SuperHi! Now on to a bit more of the homework.

**Thoughts:** The Javascript seemed to move really fast at the end of the Superhi tutorial. Planning on jumping back in to Free Code Camp to get more of a solid foundation before doing anything more complex.
