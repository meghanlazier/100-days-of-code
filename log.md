# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 5, 207

**Today's Progress**: Working through Week 4 of SuperHi foundations in HTML, CSS + Javascript. Learning about in-line block elements and varying widths using classes.

**Thoughts:** I definitely need to read more about in-line elements. I felt like the tutorial went through this really quickly. I plan on reading more of SuperHi's Learn to Code now this evening.
